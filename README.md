**First,** &nbsp; We discuss the idea of the App well to get a new features<br>
**Second,** &nbsp; We draw the initial wireframe and design of our App <br>
**Third,** &nbsp; Then we agreed on the basic points and features that we explain it above  <br>
**Forth,** &nbsp; After that we didvide our App project to many parts between our team members <br>
**Fifth,** &nbsp; we work as pairs in our team and use pair programming method "Bing Bong" <br>
**Sixth,** &nbsp; Firstly each pair have to make a test of two functions then write a function.
**Seventh,** &nbsp; Then each pair set a DOM , so Our features worked correctly <br>
**Eighth,** &nbsp;conflicts started to appear, so we worked on solving them.<br>
**Ninth,** &nbsp; Then we added our own features and set a design <br>
**last,** &nbsp; Finally Our App worked as we want then we submitted it.
